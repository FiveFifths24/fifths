# Manual Founder Setup

No credentials are needed to review public pages. The following founder-owned steps are required before live Phase 2 account testing. Never paste credentials into an issue, pull request, chat, or committed file.

## 1. Supabase

1. Create a Supabase organization owned by Five Fifths and first create a non-production branch/project in the closest practical US region for migration and RLS testing.
2. Generate and store a strong database password in a password manager.
3. In **Project Settings → API**, copy the project URL and publishable key.
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and replace only the three browser-safe placeholder values locally.
5. Invite technical collaborators individually; do not share the founder login.
6. Enable multi-factor authentication on the Supabase account.
7. Review `supabase/migrations/202608010001_phase_2_identity_foundation.sql`, then apply it to the non-production project using the Supabase SQL Editor or an authenticated Supabase CLI workflow.
8. In **Authentication → URL Configuration**, set the Site URL to the deployed application origin and add these redirect URLs for local and preview/production environments:
   - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
   - `https://<your-preview-domain>/auth/callback`
   - `https://<your-production-domain>/auth/callback`
9. Keep email confirmations enabled. Configure custom SMTP before beta; the default Supabase sender is for limited testing only.
10. Create at least two ordinary test accounts. Confirm that each account can read/update only its own profile and taxonomy selections and cannot insert, update, or delete `user_roles`.
11. Regenerate `src/types/database.ts` from the applied schema and review the diff before committing any generated update.

Do not paste or commit the database password, JWT signing key, or service-role key. Phase 2 does not require a service-role key.

## 2. Vercel

1. Sign in to Vercel with the Five Fifths GitHub account or organization.
2. Import `FiveFifths24/fifths` as a new project using the Next.js preset.
3. Keep the default build command (`next build`) and output settings.
4. Add the three public values from `.env.example` under Project Settings → Environment Variables. Use the matching preview or production application origin for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`.
5. Require preview deployments for pull requests and keep production deployment on `main` only.
6. Enable multi-factor authentication and limit project access.

## 3. GitHub branch protection

After the first pull request exists, protect `main`: require a pull request, require passing lint/type/test/build checks, block force pushes, and require the branch to be current before merging.

## 4. Required account-flow validation

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run check
```

With the non-production Supabase values configured, manually verify signup email confirmation, login, logout, password recovery, expired/invalid callback handling, onboarding, duplicate username handling, direct protected-route access, and cross-user RLS denial. Do not apply the migration to production until these checks and a legal/privacy review are complete.
